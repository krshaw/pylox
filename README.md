# Pylox
An implementation of the lox tree walk interpreter as seen in part 2 of http://craftinginterpreters.com/
Nearly all of the additional exercises are implemented, meaning my version of pylox has things like anonymous function, multiple inheritance, and the comma 
seperator operator. 

As part of the "challenge" in the last chapter of part 2, I decided to implement arrays, a seemingly missing feature of lox that is present in most programming 
languages. In the future, I also plan on implementing some sort of hashmap. 

This is an ongoing project, so I may decide to add even more features in the future. Or, maybe abandon it to work on part 3 of Crafting Interpreters, which I plan
to implement in Rust.
